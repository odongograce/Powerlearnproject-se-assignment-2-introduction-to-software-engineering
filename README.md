Software engineering: What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
The designing, building, testing and maintaining of software systems are what is called as software engineering. It emphasizes on utilizing engineering principles to ensure that the software is dependable, efficient and scalable. However, traditional programming mainly concentrates on coding for problem-solving only without taking into consideration the wider context of design, architecture and long-term maintenance. Entire process of software development lifecycle (SDLC) from requirement analysis to maintenance belong to software engineering unlike traditional programming that may involve just coding process.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1.	Requirement Analysis: Ascertaining and documenting functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders.
2.	Design: This stage involves conceptually designing the whole system by creating architectural designs showing major structures as well as key specifications such as database scheme, user interfaces (UI) etc.
3.	Implementation (Coding): This phase involves transforming the design into code using an appropriate computer language.
4.	Testing: Ensuring that it operates correctly with no defects. It encompasses unit testing, integration testing, system testing or acceptance testing among others.
5.	Deployment: This includes installation and configuration activities which enable clients access the released softwares.
6.	Maintenance: This is an ongoing process of updating and fixing the bugs in the software after it has been deployed. It makes sure that the software keeps functioning properly and can adapt to any new needs or environments (Naor, 2021). 
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall Model:
-	Linear and Sequential: Each stage must be completed before another stage is started.
-	Fixed Requirements: The requirements are defined at the beginning and do not change significantly during development.
-	Documentation-Heavy: There is a lot of documentation that goes with every phase.
Preferred Scenarios: Projects with clearly defined requirements which are less likely to change such as government contracts, and construction projects.
Agile Model:
-	Iterative and Incremental: Development in this methodology is organized into small iterations or sprints which allow for regular reassessment and adaptation.
-	Flexible Requirements: Requirements are allowed to evolve based on feedback and changing needs.
-	Collaborative and Adaptive: This model underscores teamwork, customer feedbacks, flexibility, etc.
Preferred Scenarios: Projects where requirements are expected to change such as dynamic environments or software startups.
Requirements Engineering: What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. 
Requirements engineering is the procedure of stipulating, recording and sustaining demands for software. 
This includes:
-	Elicitation: Requirements should be collected from stakeholders through interviews, observation and surveys.
-	Analysis: It refines the requirements thus making them feasible and well-understood.
-	Specification: Detailed documents need to be written down as requirements.
-	Validation: The requirements should validate a stakeholder needs accurately.
-	Management: Requirements modification over time.
This process is important in the software development lifecycle because any form of application that wishes to minimize costly revisions in its developmental cycle and satisfy user needs must begin with clear well-defined requirements.
Software Design Principles: Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? 
Modularity entails breaking down a computer program into small self-contained units or modules each responsible for a specific function. 
This enhances scalability such that developers are able to either update single modules or expand without having to re-develop the whole system. Additionally, it enables better code reuse and parallel development by use of modular design which also makes it easier to detect and correct bugs within individual modules without spreading them across other parts of the system
Testing in Software Engineering: Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? 
1.	Unit Testing-It examines the individual components or functions to ascertain that they function well on their own.
2.	Integration Testing-The tests check for interface defects in integrated units or modules.
3.	System Testing-This is a full system test to ensure it satisfies the given requirements.
4.	Acceptance Testing-It verifies that the system meets the end-user’s specific requirements and needs (Levels of Testing - Javatpoint, n.d.).
Testing is crucial for delivering high-quality, reliable, and secure software that meets user needs and expectations. It plays a vital role in the software development lifecycle by ensuring that the final product is robust and fit for purpose.
Version Control Systems: What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. 
Version control systems (VCS) keep track of every change made in the codebase. They are important because they allow multiple developers to work together easily, follow changes, go back to previous versions if necessary, and retain a record of code alterations over time.
Examples:
-	Git: This is a distributed version control system which includes branching, merging and pull requests; often used with platforms like GitHub and GitLab
-	Subversion (SVN): It is a centralized version control system which provides atomic commits and versioned directories
-	Mercurial: Another popular distributed version control system but unlike Git it was designed to be simpler for users
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? 
A software project supervises the planning, accomplishment, and production of software projects. 
Some prime tasks include:
-	Project Planning: defining the scope of a project, its objectives and what is to be delivered.
-	Resource Management: assigning team members and resources.
-	Scheduling: creating and maintaining the project timelines.
-	Risk Management: identifying and mitigating risks.
-	Communication: ensuring effective communication among stakeholders.
-	Quality Assurance: ensuring that the final product meets quality standards.

Software Maintenance: Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is updating and improving software after it has been initially released. Types of maintenance activities include:
-	Corrective Maintenance – fixing bugs and defects
-	Adaptive Maintenance – modifying software to work in new or changing environments
-	Perfective Maintenance – enhancing software features and performance
-	Preventive Maintenance – improving software to prevent future issues
Maintenance is an essential part of software lifecycle because it ensures that the software is operational, secure, up-to-date with time as well as changes in requirements/needs or environmental conditions.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering: What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? 
Some ethical issues in software engineering include:
-	Privacy: Protecting user data from unauthorized access or misuse.
-	Security: Defending software against malicious intentions.
-	Intellectual Property: Acknowledging copyrights and licenses.
-	Bias: Avoidance or mitigation of biases in algorithms as well as data.
Ethical standards for Software Engineers may involve adhering to professional codes of conduct like those set by ACM or IEEE, keeping themselves up-to-date with ethical matters, and ensuring transparency plus responsibility in their work.
